Helps to predict laptop price using logistic regression.

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist.

The dataset of laptop pricing data is available.

NB: We have taken the price of laptops having intel cores only!
